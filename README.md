Heart Disease Detection Model
This project aims to build a Classification Model that predicts the presence of heart disease based on a person's physical and clinical features. It leverages data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and employs a range of machine learning techniques to analyze and predict outcomes.

Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Disease Dataset

The dataset includes clinical and physical features collected from individuals. Key attributes are:

Age: Age of the individual
Sex: Gender (1 = male; 0 = female)
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Number of Major Vessels: (0â€“3) colored by fluoroscopy
Thal:
3 = Normal
6 = Fixed defect
7 = Reversible defect
Target:
0 = No heart disease
1 = Presence of heart disease
Goals and Objectives
Goal: Predict whether an individual has heart disease (binary classification).
Objective: Develop an accurate and interpretable machine learning model to assist healthcare professionals.
